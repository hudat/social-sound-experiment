    <p>Moved code to <b>src/</b> dir. see <b>src/index.js</b> and how it makes use of the other js files in that dir. Currently the only dependency is the tap (TestAnythingProtocol) test framework which is optional.</p>
    <h4>· Run on the commandline by `cd` into dir and then `npm install`</h4>
    <h4>· Then make sure tests pass with `npm test` on commandline (later view test/*.js file to see example unit test)</h4>
    <h4>· Finally run on the commandline by with `npm start`</h4>
    <h3>output should be the same as what we saw in the browser</h3>
    <script>
      console.log("RUN ME IN THE COMMANDLINE!");
      console.log("cd dir/");
      console.log("npm install");
      console.log("npm test");
      console.log("npm start");
